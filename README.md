# Scripts_MD
Here, I will be uploading scripts which I will be using to extract data from my MD simulation datafiles.

1. E0_T0_plot.py ---> Use this script to extract the plot between (energy and temperature) wrt the time-step of the MD simulation.
   - First run this program and then select the OSZICAR file from the GUI pop up menu.
   - The script will runa and output the (energy and temperature) wrt the timestep.
   - An example is given below -
